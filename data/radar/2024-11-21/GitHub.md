[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web-based platform used for version control and collaborative software development. It uses Git, a distributed version control system, to help developers manage and track changes to their code. GitHub provides features such as issue tracking, code review, project management, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) through GitHub Actions. It is widely used for open-source projects, private repositories, and team collaboration.
