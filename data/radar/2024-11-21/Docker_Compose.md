Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to use a YAML file to configure your application's services, networks, and volumes. With a single command, you can create and start all the services defined in the configuration. Docker Compose is commonly used for development, testing, and staging environments, making it easier to manage and orchestrate complex applications with multiple interconnected services.
