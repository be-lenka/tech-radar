Gulp.js is a JavaScript-based task runner that automates repetitive tasks in the web development workflow. It uses a code-over-configuration approach to define tasks in a JavaScript file, making it easy to read and maintain. Gulp can handle tasks such as minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, and live reloading. It leverages Node.js streams to build fast and efficient pipelines for processing files, making it a popular choice for frontend developers to streamline their development process.
