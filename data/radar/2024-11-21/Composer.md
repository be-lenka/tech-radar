Composer is a dependency management tool for PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and manages (installs/updates) them for you. Composer uses a file named `composer.json` to specify the dependencies and their versions. It also handles autoloading of classes, making it easier to include and use third-party libraries in your PHP projects. Composer is widely used in the PHP community to streamline the management of project dependencies and ensure compatibility between different packages.
