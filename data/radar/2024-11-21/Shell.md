Shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a user interface for accessing an operating system's services. Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is one of the most popular Unix shells and is the default shell on many Linux distributions and macOS. It allows users to execute commands, run scripts, and automate tasks. Bash scripts can include control structures, functions, and variables, making it a powerful tool for system administration, development, and automation.
