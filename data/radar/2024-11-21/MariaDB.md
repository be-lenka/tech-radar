[MariaDB](https://mariadb.org) MariaDB is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is a fork of MySQL. It was created by the original developers of MySQL due to concerns over Oracle Corporation's acquisition of MySQL. MariaDB aims to maintain compatibility with MySQL while providing additional features, performance improvements, and bug fixes. It is widely used for web applications, data warehousing, and other database-driven applications.
