Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It is designed to be incrementally adoptable, meaning you can use as much or as little of Vue as you need. Vue's core library focuses on the view layer only, making it easy to integrate with other libraries or existing projects. It also features an ecosystem of supporting libraries and tools to help with state management, routing, and building complex applications.
