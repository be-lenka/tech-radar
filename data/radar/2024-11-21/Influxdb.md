InfluxDB is an open-source time series database designed to handle high write and query loads. It is optimized for storing and querying time-stamped data, such as metrics, events, and analytics. InfluxDB provides a SQL-like query language called InfluxQL for interacting with data and supports features like data retention policies, continuous queries, and downsampling. It is widely used for monitoring, real-time analytics, and IoT applications.
