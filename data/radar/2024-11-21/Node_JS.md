Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side to build scalable and high-performance applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient and suitable for real-time applications like chat servers, APIs, and single-page applications. It has a rich ecosystem of libraries and modules available through npm (Node Package Manager).
