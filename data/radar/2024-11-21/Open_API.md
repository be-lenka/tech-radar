OpenAPI is a specification for building APIs that allows developers to define the structure of their APIs in a standardized format. It provides a way to describe the endpoints, request and response formats, authentication methods, and other aspects of an API. The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is language-agnostic and can be used to generate documentation, client libraries, and server stubs, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain APIs.
